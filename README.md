Mask your password with smileys

Boring [BTW, this is the standard way and binds to a good user experience]
  - As the user types the password, each character is masked by '*' character (a.k.a The Asterisk).
  
Exciting [This can make for a fun user experience and practicing CSS]
  - As the user types the password, each character is masked by an emoticon. 
  - You can customize the emoticons. Press WINDOWS KEY + DOT on your keyboard. This will open up the emoji-keyboard (if present) on your PC.
  
This is a beginner level assignment to practice Javascript/CSS.
